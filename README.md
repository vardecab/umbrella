# Umbrella

> A simple [weather page](https://vardecab.github.io/umbrella/umbrella.html) that tells you if you need to take an umbrella when going outside ‚òî + it shows air quality.

It _doesn't_ show current weather outside - you can check it yourself by looking out through a window üôÉ Umbrella will tell you the future üîÆ.

And it's kinda quick at that: [Pingdom report](https://tools.pingdom.com/#5bef88ed9f800000), [GTmetrix report](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/vardecab.github.io/snSxSCDL).
