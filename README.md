# Umbrella

>A simple [weather page](https://vardecab.github.io/umbrella/umbrella.html) that tells you if you need to take an umbrella when going outside ‚òî

It _doesn't_ show current the weather outside - you can check it yourself by looking out through a window üôÉ Umbrella will tell you the future üîÆ¬π.  

¬π _Usually looking ~ 6 hours ahead._
