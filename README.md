# Umbrella

>A simple [weather page](https://vardecab.github.io/umbrella/umbrella.html)Â¹ that tells you if you need to take an umbrella when going outside â˜”

It _doesn't_ show current the weather outside - you can check it yourself by looking out through a window ðŸ™ƒ Umbrella will tell you the future ðŸ”®Â².  

Â¹ _Currently works only in WrocÅ‚aw, Warsaw, TarnÃ³w, KrakÃ³w._

Â² _Usually looking ~ 6 hours ahead._
